Data collection at the Action Data Collection Site at Aarhus University has been completed!  

In total, 300 participants have been tested, and the dataset for each of these includes 1 hour of MRI scans, DNA sampling, and 8-12 hours of behavioural tests. It took us 20 months to collect data these nearly 3500 hours of experimental data. The data will now be carefully analysed in collaboration with our COST Action participants. We are now looking forward to finalising data collection at other sites to combine the data. A series of papers reporting the data is scheduled for the following years. Stay tuned!
