As a new year present to you, we are happy to announce that data collection at the Krakow site has kicked off and we have successfully completed the full assessment of our first batch of participants.

Following the COST routine, we have applied three MRI protocols, numerous questionnaires and the comprehensive set of the behavioural tasks investigating different aspects of conscious experience and related phenomena.  
Despite corona-related restrictions, we will now move along with data collection at a steady pace and hopefully increase throughput soon, once things open up again. We estimate we will collect the planned sample of 300 participants on spring 2022.
